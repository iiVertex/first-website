        <p>Syllabus overview
            Cambridge IGCSE Computer Science helps learners 
            develop an interest in 
            computational thinking and an understanding of the 
            principles of problem-solving using computers. 
            They apply this understanding to create computer-based 
            solutions to problems using algorithms and a 
            high-level 
            programming language. Learners also develop a 
            range of 
            technical skills, and the ability to effectively 
            test and 
            evaluate computing solutions.
            
            Studying Cambridge IGCSE Computer Science helps 
            learners 
            appreciate current and emerging computing 
            technologies, 
            the benefits of their use and recognise their 
            potential 
            risks. It provides an ideal foundation for 
            progression to 
            Cambridge International AS & A Level and is 
            valuable for 
            other areas of study and everyday life.</p>
